# RecipeBootstrap
[Live Demo](http://alisonchilders.com/recipebootstrap/recipecentral.html)

## Description
A recipe website project to practice my Bootstrap and layout skills.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome for icons

In my Udemy Bootcamp, we were tasked with taking a static page example and using Bootstrap to imitate the layout, but we could change anything about it we wanted.  

The main goal was to practice using Bootstrap and to have it be COMPLETELY responsive.

Enjoy!
